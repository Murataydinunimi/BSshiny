# BSshiny

The shiny app calculates option prices through BS formula and shows the plots of Calls and Puts against their strikes.

As an example, the app extracts the option prices of SP index in real time and presents it to the user after doing some simple manipulations on the data. So, the user can wish to use any option's values to price it simply copying and pasting from the datatable to the interactive part where the arguments for BS formula is required.
