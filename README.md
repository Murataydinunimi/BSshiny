# BSshiny

The shiny app calculates option prices through BS formula and shows the plots of Calls and Puts against their strikes.

As an example, the app extracts the option prices of SP index in real time and presents it to the user after doing some simple manipulations on the data. So, the user can wish to use any option's values to price it simply doing copy-paste from the datatable to the interactive part where the arguments for BS formula are required.

Note that the S&P dataset that the app extracts from two different sources are created only to be an example for the user. The volatility/Maturity/Interest rates given in this dataset are not correct but solely provided for the user to use for the BS calculation and see the relationship between the variables given in the dataset.
